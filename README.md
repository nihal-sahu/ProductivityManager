# ProductivityManager

A to-do list web app developed with ReactJS for front end and JSON server for backend. 

This is my web app that I use to manage my day-to-day tasks. The web app is hosted on my Raspberry Pi and the "backend" is a JSON file on my localhost. 

I am currently working on implementing a backend using SQL.
